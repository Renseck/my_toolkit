# my_toolkit
A library with a bunch of useful numierical functions in it for me. These are mainly related to some standard data cleaning, removing outliers, and having some tools for fitting simple mathematical functions to data, to get an idea of relationships. 

## Installation
Make sure you have Python installed. Then clone the repo, navigate to its root with a Python-ready terminal and run `pip install .`. 

## Usage
Start by using `import my-toolkit`. You can then access its functions as you see fit.
